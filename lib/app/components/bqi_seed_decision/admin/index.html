Dear Professor {{project.flow.stages.application.data.pi.name}}:

Thank you for submitting your proposal “{{project.title}}” for seed funding at the Big Questions Incubator. While the proposal had considerable intellectual merit, it was not selected for funding at this time. You can see more detailed comments from the Advisory Council on your BQI portal: http://bigquestions.uchicago.edu/portal

The Big Questions Incubator has a particular mission to support early-stage projects with a potential to be transformative in their field. Our initial focus areas are Information, Complexity, and Cognition, and alignment with the guiding Big Questions (http://bigquestions.uchicago.edu/funding) is an important funding criterion.

We are committed to supporting genuinely novel research ideas at the University of Chicago that are not yet ripe enough for external funding. Should you have a future project that aligns with the program’s goals, we hope you will consider applying for funding from the BQI.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss.

Sincerely,

Elena Zinchenko, Ed. D.
Director of Research Innovation
